# Air-Craft-Propeller

This project involves designing and assembling a detailed model of an aircraft propeller using SOLIDWORKS. The assembly includes all major components, such as the blades, hub, and mounting hardware, with attention to accuracy and functionality.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a highly detailed and accurate 3D model of an aircraft propeller using SOLIDWORKS. This model can be used for educational purposes, simulations, and further design enhancements. The assembly ensures that all parts fit together seamlessly and mimic the actual propellerâ€™s operation.

Features
Detailed Components: Each part of the propeller, from the blades to the hub, is modeled with precision.
Realistic Textures and Materials: Appropriate materials and textures are applied to enhance the realism.
Functional Assembly: The assembly allows for movement simulation, such as blade pitch adjustments.
Technical Drawings: Includes technical drawings for manufacturing and educational purposes.
Simulation Ready: Ready for static and dynamic analysis to test functionality and durability.


Components
Blades: The aerodynamic surfaces that generate thrust.
Hub: The central part that holds the blades together.
Mounting Hardware: Includes bolts, nuts, and other fasteners for assembly.
Spinner: The aerodynamic cover that improves airflow over the hub.
